# Useless-Machine

A useless machine is a machine that has no conceivable purpose for existing, and are often intended as jokes. Some useless machines have the sole function of turning themselves off or breaking themselves. The class UselessMachine.java actually deletes itself, therefore "breaking the machine." I have also included CodeFixer.java, which restores UselessMachine.java by actually making a new file with the same code.

Note that both UselessMachine.java and CodeFixer.java delete their .class files. This is in order to keep the package clean, rather than littered with .class files.

Please enjoy this waste of time and energy.
